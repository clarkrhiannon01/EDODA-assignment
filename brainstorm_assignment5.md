Question 1: What is a problem you’d like to solve using Data Analysis skills? Think of a question, problem, or transformation that includes a modern dataset that needs to be accessed via computational tools like those we’ve just started to explore. This could include exploratory work, or development of a specific kind of Reusable software element (like a calculation, transformation or modeling excercise):
The probel I'd like to be solving would be "at what rate does ice melt and freshwater input effect the denisty in the ocean" 

Question 2: What kind of computational steps do you think this project would entail. At the least, describe in words a few things you think you woudl need to do. Better - sketch out an ‘outline’ for a Python project that woudl accomplish these steps. You can refer to simular skills outlined above.
I would need to find data from the global water density and the ice melt in the spand 1931-1955 and compare the two 

Question 3: What kind of data woudl you use? Be specific here. Is there a data object type that you know you’d be working with? Are you working with a specific data set, if so, what is the data source? What format does the data come in and how do you access it?
I am using data from NOAA: http://ccma.nos.noaa.gov/ecosystems/sanctuaries/stellwagen_nms/ 
this would be intersting to look at becaus eof the greenland ice sheets melting and the fresh water being distributed into the gulf of mexico through currents 
Learning Goals

The goal of the final project is to assess your ability to combine and apply the skills you have learned in class in the context of a real-world research problem. Our class has mostly focused on tools for data analysis and visualization, so this must be the focus of your final project. Specifically, we seek to assess your ability to do the following tasks:

Discover and download real datasets in standard formats (e.g. CSV, netCDF)
Load the data into Pandas or Xarray, performing any necessary data cleanup (dealing with missing values, proper time encoding, etc.) along the way.
Perform realistic scientific calculation involving, for example tasks such as grouping, aggregating, and applying mathematical formulas.
Visualize your results in well-formatted plots.

Whatever you choose, you should clearly define a hypothesis or scientific question that you aim to investigate with your analysis. This will determine what you have to do.

The results of this analysis will be figures. Beautiful figures which clearly provide answers to your question / hypothesis. Your notebook should contain at least 4 and no more than 8 figures. If you have closer to 4, they should be complex, multi-panel figures. All figures must have titles, clearly labeled axes, informative colormaps / colorbars, and legends, where appropriate.
